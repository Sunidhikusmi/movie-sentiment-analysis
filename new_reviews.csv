review
This movie was absolutely fantastic
The story was boring and predictable
Amazing acting and great direction
Worst movie I have ever watched
Loved the cinematography and soundtrack
The plot was dull and the characters were uninteresting
Great visual effects but weak storyline
An unforgettable experience, truly a masterpiece  
Horrible script and terrible pacing
Mediocre at best, not worth the time
